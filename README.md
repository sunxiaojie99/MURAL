# MURAL: A Multi-Granularity-Aware Aspect Learning Model for Multi-Aspect Dense Retrieval

This repo contains the source code of our paper in WSDM 2024: A Multi-Granularity-Aware Aspect Learning Model for Multi-Aspect Dense Retrieval

- This project builds upon [Tevatron](https://github.com/texttron/tevatron)
- For the pre-training, run src/config_run_pretrain.sh
- For the fine-tuning, run src/pretrain_finetune1_c.sh
